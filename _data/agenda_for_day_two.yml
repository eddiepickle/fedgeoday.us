    - title: Introduction to QGIS
      description: This workshop is designed to introduce you to QGIS 3, an Open Source GIS software for viewing, editing, and managing spatial data in a wide variety of commonly used vector and raster formats. It is lightweight, flexible, and can be installed on Windows, MacOSX, and Linux. We will cover installing the software, displaying and symbolizing data and creating a map.

    - title: OpenStreetMap US & TeachOSM
      description: >
        This session will include an introduction to editing in OpenStreetMap (the free, editable map of the whole world) followed by a mapathon.<br/><br/>
        Participants will gain a basic understanding of adding data to OpenStreetMap and then we will map part of the world together using the Tasking Manager. This session is open to mappers of all skill levels! No cost to join, but there is a suggested donation to OpenStreetMap US, the nonprofit that supports the OSM community in the US.

    - title: Data Visualization and Cartography with QGIS
      description: "This workshop will explore the wide range of data visualization and cartographic options available in QGIS 3. QGIS has seen remarkable growth in it's cartogrpahic capacities in recent years. You will learn many techniques unique to QGIS such as: use of inverted polygon shapeburst fills, blending modes, live layer effects and geometry generator symbol layers. We will also work with animating time based data, 3D views and Mesh data. If you want to take your map creation skills to the next level - this is the perfect workshop for you!"
